Learning JavaScript is easy.
Just follow the guideline!
Let's start!!!

---

# Basic JavaScript

## Introduction

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

## What to learn first?

> As other languages, the most essential things to learn are:
> + Syntax - how to write correct code.
>   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp" target="_blank">Read more.</a>
> + Variables - how to declare variables.
>   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" target="_blank">Read more.</a>
> + Functions - how to declare and call functions.
>   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

The other contents are also important. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">Just check them here later when you need them.</a>

Try to understand

```javascript
// callback

function run(arg1, arg2, ...){

}

promise
```

## Improved scripts

ECMAScript, CoffeeScript and TypeScript may confuse you as a beginner.
Later in this guideline we will use example in `ES6`.

So if you want a fast start, then ignore the details of the rest concepts.
Knowing that they exist is enough.

+ ECMAScript
  ECMAScript 5th Edition(ES5), ECMAScript 2015(ES6), ECMAScript 2016(ES7) and ECMAScript 2017(ES8) are just different versions of JavaScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

+ CoffeeScript
  CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

+ TypeScript
  TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank">Read more.</a>

Try to understand

```javascript
// Arrow function
() => ();
() => {};

```
