## Shell

`sh` (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (`ksh88`, `dash`, ...).

`bash` can also be considered an implementation of sh.

## Command

`#!/bin/sh` will use sh (and whatever that happens to point to). For a long time, it is a symlink or hardlink to `/bin/bash` by default in many OS.

`#!/bin/bash` will use `/bin/bash` if it's available (and fail with an error message if it's not).

Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g. `#!/bin/dash`


## Execution

#### source

``` bash
$ source a.sh
$ . a.sh # There is space between . and a.sh
```

Execute in current shell and keep environment change from a.sh.

#### sh/bash

``` bash
$ sh a.sh
$ bash a.sh
```

Execute in a subshell and environment does not change in parent shell.

####  ./

``` bash
./a.sh
```

Need permission to execute in a subshell and environment does not change in parent shell.

#### fork、source、exec

``` bash
./a.sh fork
./a.sh source
./a.sh exec
```

`fork` creates a child process to execute a.sh and will not change the current environment after execution.

`source` executes a.sh in current process and will change the environment according to a.sh.

`exec` is similar to source but will terminate current process.

By default, `fork` is applied.
