## Shell

`sh` (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (`ksh88`, `dash`, ...).

`bash` can also be considered an implementation of sh.

## Command

`#!/bin/sh` will use sh (and whatever that happens to point to). For a long time, it is a symlink or hardlink to `/bin/bash` by default in many OS.

`#!/bin/bash` will use `/bin/bash` if it's available (and fail with an error message if it's not).

Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g. `#!/bin/dash`
